# UI Testing
Convenor: Toni


* Decouple Ui from functionality 
* Test Ui only for Button enablement etc
* Jep (page object pattern)/squish/Spock on top of selenium
* Jelly jammy for swing 
* QFtest
* Do all the state in a model as well and test the states and then it should have binding 
* Using images screenshots or convert PDF to image, remove some area and compare the images 
* Redux pattern
* Educate people that it's better to decouple even if there's some duplication 
* Controls4j
* Fest cacio swing and headless testing
* Is it really worth it? Scenario testing 
* Tests are sometimes failing if the Ui gets to fast
