# Intro to JVM Bytecode
Convenor: Ben Evans

* Here is the repo for the Ocelot simple bytecode interpreter: https://github.com/kittylyst/ocelotvm
* If you haven’t ever looked at the source code of an interpreter before, please look at the 0.1.1 release, https://github.com/kittylyst/ocelotvm/releases/tag/0.1.1 as it is very easy to understand
* People who came to today’s bytecode session might also want the examples repo from “Optimizing Java” that was also shown: https://github.com/kittylyst/optimizing-java (the book is at: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920042983.do )
