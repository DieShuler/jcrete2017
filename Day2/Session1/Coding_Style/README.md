# Bugs & Coding Style

* Bugs are proportional to lines of code - REALLY!!!!
*   Blank lines & comments & asserts don't count against you
*   Moving the openning brace down a row DOES count against you
*   Trinary op helps reduce lines of code
* Dense code gets more done per-bug!!!
* NEW FUNCTIONALITY code has a higher bug rate, by 10x over refactoring
* REFACTORING or tech-debt-elimination has a high bug rate than bug fixes
* BUG FIXES rarely has bugs, but commonly doesn't fix the whole of the original bug
* Also, coders still have the exponential distribution on their individual coding speed

* I've never seen a coding style "save" a project
* I've seen plenty of coding style "wars" wreck teams
* When writing new code, do NOT put roadblocks in front of the programmer, such
   as a required coding style.  They are on an exploratory journey, and need to
   feel creative and "code fast, fail fast, explore fast".

* Use more "2-D" coding blocks.  The eye naturally works in 2-D, and can
   rapidly spot differences - and lets the brain learn the boilerplate once and
   then focus on the special bits.  EMACS lets me edit 2-D blocks easily.
